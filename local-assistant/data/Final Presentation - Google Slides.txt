Quantifying the Carbon, Cost, and ROI Footprint of LLMs

2
AI’s “Jagged Frontier” of Productivity
+12% more tasks completed
+25% faster execution 
+40% higher quality 
−19% accuracy outside AI’s capability
Risks:
Overtrust in AI 
homogenization
long-term skill erosion
The Problem Landscape

3
Adoption
Economic uncertainty shapes adoption ￼
Volatile ROI expectations →hesitation
Public sentiment dictates AI adoption
Anthropic Economic Index → sentiment shifts, optimism cycles

4
Sustainability
Sustainability cost often overlooked:
LLM inference energy consumption → 
joules/token → kWh → $/CO
Data Center externalities: 
carbon emission  
water consumption

Data Sources
Harvard/BCG Productivity Study - Measured how AI impacts knowledge worker productivity, showing gains but also risks like overtrust and reduced diversity.
Anthropic Economic Index - racks real-time economic sentiment (inflation, jobs, AI optimism) from human + AI conversations to signal adoption timing.
Hugging Face Energy Dataset - Captures the energy use and CO₂ footprint of AI models across hardware and workloads, highlighting sustainability tradeoffs.

Every AI response uses energy, but what really drives that cost?
We interact with AI every day, but rarely think about the power behind our prompts.
Could text complexity be the reason? Or something deeper ,the models themselves?

The Big Question

Dataset Overview
Hugging Face LLM Energy Dataset (78,000 entries) Each entry has:
 Energy metrics → total & per-token usage
Model attributes → name, token length, architecture
Text complexity → word count, diversity, readability
Timestamps → generation time & duration

8
Data Preparation
Removed duplicates and unnamed columns
Standardized units for consistency across models
Calculated New Metrics:
Energy(Wh)
Cost(USD)
CO2 emission(grams)
ROI(tokens per dollar)
Selected 7 key numerical features for analysis

      
Standardized units
Dropped Duplicates  and NAN Entries
Engineered new metrics
Selected Key  Features

Correlation Findings
-Analyzed relationship between text features and energy usage 
-All correlations were near zero(r<0.1)
-Indicates text complexity doesn’t drive  energy consumption

10
PCA Visualization
Reduces all numerical variables (text, response, and energy metrics)into 2 main components

Clustering by model size

Minimal separation based on text-based features

Suggests that model characteristics drive energy variance 

11
Modeling: Decision Tree 
Response length is the most important predictor of energy use.

ROI:Tokens per dollar spent

Cost vs CO₂ Emissions



Summary
Text complexity and readability have minimal impact on energy use.

Model size and response length are the main energy drivers.

Smaller models(like Gemma-2B)->higher ROI, lower emissions

Larger models(like Llama-70B)->more powerful, less efficient

Next Steps
Put data insights into a dashboard arrangement
Add interactive visualizations for model comparisons (ROI, cost, CO₂)

Test dashboard usability and refine based on feedback
